## Description

<article>
   	<p >
								The native app is built to extend the 
								<a

									>
									Home Book Next.js full-stack web application
								</a>
								by consuming its API Routes and reusing the same database and
								business logic. All user-facing functionalities available in the
								Next.js app have been fully migrated to this React Native
								application. This ensures a seamless cross-platform experience,
								allowing users to book products on the native app and later view
								their orders on the web app, and vice versa.

							<p >
								<strong>Clerk</strong> handles authentication and integration
								with the backend to support both demo user login and standard
								login flow.

								<strong>Nativewind</strong> enables consistent UI styling and
								faster development.
